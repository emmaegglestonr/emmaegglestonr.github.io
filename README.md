## How many children recieve a free or reduced-price lunch in the U.S.?
The source of this data is the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service. [Original Data Set](https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/child-nutrition-tables)
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the NSLP at the federal level, and nearly 100,000 public and nonprofit private schools participate in the program. A student with an income at or below 130% of the poverty income threshold qualifies for free or reduced-price lunch. In the 2021-2022 school year school breakfast and lunch was free to any student regardless of income due to the pandemic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture keeps a record of how many school meals were distributed under the National School Lunch Program. They key findings of this data show that more than half of all public school students recieved a free or reduced-price lunch in the federal fiscal year of 2022. Certain ethnic groups recieve more free or reduced lunches because the qualifications are based on poverty levels. Pennsylvania saw a slight decrease in the number of students recieving a free or reduced lunch between the years of 2019 and 2022 while some states saw a sharp increase. This could be because of different economic policies in each state as well as varying inflation rates, job opportunities, and average household incomes. Some politicians want to make school lunch free again for all students under the Universal Free Meals Act of 2021 as it was during the pandemic however Congress has not passed this bill.
